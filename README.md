GeoPress – Quick News and Alerts for Nearby Crime

In today’s fast-paced age  news is a lot but  scattered and lacking in case of geographic context. Individuals may hear about any  incident but have no  way of knowing where it occurred and how close incident or crime area.
This lack of location-based awareness can delay proper  action and reduce public safety.
The gap between now days news reporting and geographically relevant news increase. Crime incidents, road accidents, or safety alerts are often covered in lengthy articles without tools to instantly visualize their location of crime or accidents.
Without a system that extracts and maps these events automatically 
users must rely on manual searches which is a time-consuming process that reduces responsiveness during emergencies.

Objectives:
•	Extract location data from digital news articles in real-time.
•	Provide instant Google Maps search links for detected locations.
•	Improve public safety by enabling quick awareness of nearby incidents.
•	Create a clean, web-based interface for browsing incident updates.
Scope:
•	Covers local, city, and regional crime or incident reporting.
•	Primarily targeted at individuals, journalists, and community safety groups.
•	Extensible to other alert categories (e.g., weather, traffic jams, health hazards).

 Methodology
•	Data Collection: Scan incoming news articles from online sources.
•	NLP Processing: Use NLP (Natural Language Processing) to extract location names (cities, neighborhoods, landmarks).
•	Mapping: Generate Google Maps search links dynamically for each extracted location.
•	User Interface: Present concise news headlines with clickable map links.
•	Deployment: Host the application on Render for public access.

Software & Tools:
•	Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
•	Backend: Node.js, Express.js
•	Database: MongoDB Atlas
•	NLP Library: compromise.js or equivalent JS-based NLP tool
•	Maps Integration: Google Maps Search API/URLs
•	Deployment: Render
 Future Work
•	In future we create location search bar for check specific location crime 
•	Integrating AI-powered crime trend prediction based on historical data.
•	Adding multilingual support for regional news sources.
•	Push notifications for incidents occurring within a specified radius of the user.
